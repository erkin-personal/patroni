* Build from Repository


First of all, git clone https://github.com/zalando/patroni.git

Afterwards, make the necessary changes in the files.

Then build the image Patroni image:


docker build -t patroni:latest .


* Setting up the Stack


docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml patroni


Wait for a few mins:

Then check for services:


docker service ls (on manager node)
docker ps (on worker nodes)

Since this is a docker swarm stack, you will notice that services will run and docker containers will be placed in the 3 nodes of docker swarm.


This is 

Have fun !
